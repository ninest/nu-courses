The goals of the capstone are to develop skills in communicating the results of independent projects; increase student awareness of research in biotechnology outside of their own work; demonstrate a familiarity with the literature background to their work, including a working knowledge of literature searching; and provide an opportunity to reflect on individual progress toward a career in biotechnology.",

    "description": "Presents a laboratory course in biotechnology with a focus on cutting-edge instrumentation that is currently used in the field.  Directs special attention at the practical aspects of laboratory work in this field, for example, techniques in sample preparation, procedures for protein analysis, and new bioinformatic approaches.  Focuses on the emerging field of chemiproteomics, which is the study of the interaction of small molecules with the proteome, that is, the full complement of proteins expressed in an individual cell or organism.  Exposes the student to hands-on experience with modern instrumentation, such as mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography.",
